# RFC Account

**Priority: 🟠 HIGH**

## Overview

A **Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) Account** allows returning NRIs to hold their foreign currency earnings in India **without mandatory conversion to INR**. This provides flexibility and protection against exchange rate fluctuations while maintaining full repatriation capability.

## Key Action

> **Open RFC account, do NOT convert all dollars to rupees**

## Eligibility

To open an RFC account, you must:
- Have resided abroad for **at least 1 year** (or 182+ days in a financial year) before returning
- Be returning to India for **permanent settlement**
- Be an NRI, PIO (Person of Indian Origin), or OCI (Overseas Citizen of India)

This facility has been available for those returning on or after **April 18, 1992**.

## Key Benefits

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Fully Repatriable** | Funds can be transferred abroad **anytime** without RBI restrictions |
| **Bypasses LRS Limit** | Not subject to the $250,000/year Liberalized Remittance Scheme limit |
| **Interest Tax-Free** | During RNOR period (up to 3 years) |
| **Currency Protection** | Hold in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD |
| **DICGC Coverage** | Deposit insurance up to ₹5 lakhs per bank per depositor |
| **No Time Limit** | Funds can remain in RFC account indefinitely |

## Account Features

### Account Types
- **Current Account**: Day-to-day transactions
- **Savings Account**: Some banks may not offer cheque facilities
- **Term Deposit**: Fixed deposits in foreign currency

### Currencies Accepted
- US Dollars (USD)
- Euro (EUR)
- British Pounds (GBP)
- Japanese Yen (JPY)
- Australian Dollars (AUD)
- Other freely convertible currencies (bank-dependent)

### Joint Holding
- Can be held jointly with a **resident Indian relative** on a 'former or survivor' basis
- The resident relative **cannot operate** the account during the lifetime of the primary holder

## RBI Regulations

Under **FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act), 1999**, returning NRIs must:

1. Convert existing **NRE accounts** to Resident Savings OR transfer to RFC
2. Convert existing **NRO accounts** to Resident Savings OR close them
3. **FCNR(B) deposits** can be maintained until maturity, then must be converted to RFC or resident account

The RFC account provides an alternative to mandatory rupee conversion.

## Why RFC Bypasses the $250K LRS Limit

The **Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS)** limits resident Indians to sending $250,000 abroad per financial year. However:

- **RFC funds are already foreign currency** held in India
- Repatriation from RFC is **not considered a remittance** under LRS
- You can transfer **unlimited amounts** from RFC abroad

This is crucial for NRIs with significant foreign assets who may need to move money back abroad.

## Taxation

| Your Status | Interest Taxation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **RNOR** (Years 1-3) | ❌ Tax-free |
| **ROR** (Year 4+) | ✅ Taxable at slab rates |

## Required Documents

To open an RFC account, typically you need:

1. ✅ RFC Account Opening Form
2. ✅ Passport copy (all relevant pages)
3. ✅ Valid visa and immigration stamps (proof of 1+ year foreign stay)
4. ✅ PAN Card or Form 60
5. ✅ Passport-size photograph
6. ✅ RFC Declaration Form
7. ✅ Proof of overseas address

## How to Open

### Step 1: Choose a Bank
Most major Indian banks offer RFC accounts:
- State Bank of India
- HDFC Bank
- ICICI Bank
- Axis Bank
- Standard Chartered
- Kotak Mahindra

### Step 2: Visit the Branch
In-person visit required with documentation

### Step 3: Transfer Funds
Transfer from:
- Existing NRE account
- FCNR deposits (upon maturity)
- Direct wire from abroad
- Sale proceeds of foreign assets

## Strategic Uses

### 1. Currency Hedge
Keep funds in USD/EUR while rupee fluctuates. Convert to INR when exchange rates are favorable.

### 2. Future Foreign Needs
- Children's overseas education
- International travel
- Medical treatment abroad
- Investment opportunities outside India

### 3. Option to Return Abroad
If India doesn't work out, RFC funds remain fully accessible for relocation.

### 4. Estate Planning
RFC balances can be passed to heirs (subject to FEMA regulations for nominees).

## Comparison: RFC vs NRE vs NRO

| Feature | RFC | NRE (as NRI) | NRO (as NRI) |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Who can open | Returning NRIs | NRIs only | NRIs, PIOs |
| Currency | Foreign | Foreign | INR |
| Repatriability | 100% | 100% | $1M/year |
| Interest tax in India | RNOR: No, ROR: Yes | No | Yes |
| LRS limit applies | No | N/A | Yes |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Converting all foreign currency to INR immediately**
- You lose repatriation flexibility
- Subject to LRS limits for future remittances

❌ **Not opening RFC before converting NRE**
- Once NRE is converted to resident savings, you cannot move funds back to RFC

❌ **Assuming RFC interest is always tax-free**
- Only exempt during RNOR period; taxable after becoming ROR
