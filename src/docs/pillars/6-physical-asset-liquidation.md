# Physical Asset Liquidation

**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM**

## Overview

Strategic timing for **selling US property** is crucial when returning to India. The "trial period" approach—renting initially rather than selling immediately—provides flexibility, tax advantages during RNOR, and the option to return if India doesn't work out.

## Key Action

> **Consider renting US house initially (trial period)**

## Why Consider Renting First

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rental Income Tax-Free in India** | During RNOR period, foreign rental income is NOT taxable in India |
| **Option to Return** | Keep the door open if relocation doesn't work out |
| **Property Appreciation** | Continue building equity in a potentially rising market |
| **Dollar Income** | Hedge against rupee depreciation |
| **Time to Decide** | 2-3 years to evaluate your India experience |
| **Avoid Rushed Sale** | Don't sell at the wrong time in market cycles |

## FIRPTA: Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act

When a foreign person sells US real estate, **FIRPTA** applies. The buyer must withhold tax and remit to the IRS.

### Withholding Rates

| Sale Price | Buyer's Intended Use | Withholding Rate |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Below $300,000 | Personal residence | **0%** |
| $300,000 - $1,000,000 | Personal residence | **10%** |
| Above $1,000,000 | Personal residence | **15%** |
| Any amount | Investment property | **15%** |

### Key FIRPTA Facts

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Withholding vs Final Tax** | Withholding is an advance payment; actual tax may differ |
| **Filing Requirement** | Must file Form 1040NR after sale to calculate true liability |
| **Refund Possible** | If withholding exceeds actual tax, you can claim a refund |
| **Reduced Withholding** | File Form 8288-B before closing to request lower withholding |
| **Buyer's Responsibility** | Buyer (not you) is the withholding agent |

### FIRPTA Timeline

1. **Before Sale**: Consider filing Form 8288-B for reduced withholding
2. **At Closing**: Buyer withholds required percentage
3. **Within 20 Days**: Buyer files Form 8288 and 8288-A with IRS
4. **Tax Year End**: You file Form 1040NR reporting the sale
5. **Refund (if applicable)**: Claim refund for over-withholding

## Capital Gains Tax Considerations

### By Residential Status

| Status | US Capital Gains Tax | India Capital Gains Tax |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **NRI (Non-resident in India)** | Yes - FIRPTA applies | No |
| **RNOR** | Yes - Must file US return | **No** - Foreign income exempt |
| **ROR** | Yes - US tax applies | Yes - But claim DTAA credit |

### US Tax Rates on Property Sale

| Category | Tax Rate |
|----------|----------|
| **Short-term capital gain** (held < 1 year) | Ordinary income rates (up to 37%) |
| **Long-term capital gain** (held > 1 year) | 15% or 20% (based on income level) |
| **Section 121 Exclusion** | $250K single / $500K married (if lived 2 of last 5 years) |

### Section 121 Exclusion

If you **lived in the home** as your primary residence for at least **2 of the last 5 years** before sale:
- Exclude up to **$250,000** gain (single) or **$500,000** (married filing jointly)
- **Important**: Clock is ticking—you must sell within 3 years of moving out to use full exclusion
- Prorated exclusion may apply for partial periods

## Rental Income During RNOR

If you rent your US property during RNOR period:

### US Taxation
- Rental income is taxable in US (you remain a US tax person for that income)
- Claim deductions: mortgage interest, property taxes, depreciation, management fees
- May result in little or no US tax due to expenses

### India Taxation
- During RNOR: **Tax-free** (foreign income exemption)
- After becoming ROR: Taxable in India at slab rates, claim DTAA credit for US taxes paid

### Property Management
If renting while in India, you'll need:
- Property management company (typically 8-10% of rent)
- Plan for maintenance and repairs
- Consider landlord liability insurance
- Document handover before departure

## Selling Strategy Timeline

### Option A: Sell During RNOR Period (Recommended for Most)

| Timing | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Year 1-2 in India** | Capital gains not taxable in India |
| **File US taxes** | Pay LTCG (15-20%) in US only |
| **No double taxation** | India exempts foreign capital gains during RNOR |

### Option B: Sell After Becoming ROR

| Timing | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Year 4+ in India** | Worldwide income taxable in India |
| **File both** | Report in US (FIRPTA) and India (slab rates) |
| **DTAA Credit** | Claim foreign tax credit in India for US taxes paid |
| **May be neutral** | If US tax rate ≈ India effective rate, DTAA credit offsets |

### Option C: Never Sell (Hold as Investment)

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Rental income** | Taxable in both countries (post-RNOR) |
| **Appreciation** | Continues building |
| **Estate planning** | Passes to heirs (consider US estate tax if >$60K for non-residents) |
| **Management hassle** | Ongoing from 10,000 miles away |

## Other US Assets to Consider

### Bank Accounts

| Type | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|
| **US Checking/Savings** | Keep one for receiving SS, managing investments |
| **US Brokerage** | Many brokers have restrictions on non-resident accounts |
| **Credit Cards** | May keep for US purchases; maintain US credit history |

### Vehicles

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Sell before leaving** | Simplest; immediate cash | May not get best price |
| **Ship to India** | Keep beloved car | 165% import duty! Not recommended |
| **Store temporarily** | Wait for better price | Insurance, maintenance costs |

### Household Goods

See Transfer of Residence (TR) scheme in Logistics section:
- Used household goods (1+ year old): Duty-free up to ₹50,000
- Electronics, appliances: 38.5% duty
- **Recommendation**: Sell large electronics; ship smaller sentimental items

## Tax Optimization Strategies

### 1. Maximize Section 121 Exclusion
Sell within 3 years of moving to use full $250K/$500K exclusion.

### 2. Time Sale for Low-Income Year
If possible, sell in a year when your other income is low to stay in 15% LTCG bracket.

### 3. Installment Sale
Spread gain over multiple years using installment sale treatment.

### 4. 1031 Exchange (Advanced)
Exchange US property for another US property to defer gains (complex for non-residents).

### 5. Rent During RNOR
Collect tax-free rental income in India while waiting for optimal sale timing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Selling immediately before understanding tax implications**
- May miss Section 121 exclusion
- May sell in poor market conditions

❌ **Not filing Form 8288-B for reduced withholding**
- 15% withheld upfront means waiting for refund

❌ **Ignoring US tax obligations after moving to India**
- Still must file 1040NR for US-source income

❌ **Not reporting sale in India after becoming ROR**
- Must report in Schedule FA and pay applicable taxes

❌ **Shipping car to India**
- 165% duty makes this almost never worthwhile

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I avoid FIRPTA by selling to a relative?

**A**: Yes. File Form 1040NR for rental income from US property.

### Q: Can I use a 1031 exchange to buy property in India?
