# Healthcare Continuity

**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM**

## Overview

Indian health insurance policies have **Pre-Existing Disease (PED) waiting periods** of up to 3 years. Strategic pre-purchase while abroad ensures **full coverage from Day 1** upon return, avoiding a critical gap in healthcare protection.

## Key Action

> **Maintain policy while abroad to exhaust waiting periods**

## The Problem: Waiting Periods

When you buy health insurance in India, most policies don't cover pre-existing conditions immediately. IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) regulations allow insurers to impose waiting periods.

### IRDAI Waiting Period Rules (As of April 2024)

| Waiting Period Type | Duration |
|--------------------|----------|
| **Pre-Existing Disease (PED)** | **3 years maximum** (reduced from 4 years) |
| **Specific illnesses clause** | 2-4 years depending on insurer |
| **Initial waiting period** | 30 days (except accidents) |

**Key Update**: As of April 1, 2024, IRDAI reduced the maximum PED waiting period from 4 years to 3 years.

## The Solution: Pre-Purchase Strategy

### Timeline
1. **3 Years Before Return**: Purchase Indian health insurance
2. **Years 1-3**: Maintain policy while abroad (pay premiums annually)
3. **Upon Return**: All PED waiting periods are exhausted—full coverage from Day 1

### Benefits
| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Day 1 Coverage** | Full benefits immediately upon return |
| **No waiting period anxiety** | Pre-existing conditions covered |
| **Cost advantage** | Indian premiums significantly lower than US |
| **Family coverage** | Include spouse and children |
| **Prevents coverage gap** | Critical for conditions requiring ongoing treatment |

## Key Features to Look For

### Must-Have Features

- ✅ **Restoration Benefit** (sum insured restored after claim)
- ✅ **Day Care Procedures** (surgeries not requiring 24hr hospitalization)
- ✅ **Pre/Post Hospitalization** (60-180 days coverage)

### Good-to-Have Features

- ⭐ **OPD Cover** (doctor visits, medicines)
- ⭐ **Maternity Coverage** (typically 2-4 year waiting)
- ⭐ **Mental Health Coverage** (now mandatory per IRDAI 2025)
- ⭐ **Global Coverage Add-on** (for occasional travel)

## Disclosure Requirements

### Critical: Declare Everything
When purchasing Indian health insurance:

1. **Disclose all pre-existing conditions honestly**
2. **Provide complete medical history**
3. **Include any ongoing medications**
4. **Report previous surgeries/hospitalizations**

### Why Honesty Matters
- Non-disclosure can lead to **claim rejection**
- Policy can be **voided entirely**
- You lose all paid premiums
- May be blacklisted by insurers

## Special Considerations for Returning NRIs

### 1. Coverage Territory
Most Indian health insurance plans cover medical expenses **only within India**. If you travel abroad:
- OPD costs abroad: Not covered
- Emergency abroad: May have limited coverage
- Consider a global add-on if you travel frequently

### 2. Port Existing NRI Policy
Some insurers allow porting from NRI-specific plans to regular resident plans:
- Accumulated No Claim Bonus may be preserved
- Waiting periods already served carry over
- Check with your current insurer

### 3. Mental Health Coverage
**IRDAI 2025 Mandate**: All health insurance policies must cover mental health under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.
- Therapy sessions (CBT)
- Psychiatric hospitalization
- Outpatient counseling
- Medication

### 4. Age Considerations
- Premiums increase significantly after age 45
- Co-pays may be imposed for senior citizens
- Consider "lifetime renewability" guaranteed policies
- Family floater may not be ideal for parents—consider separate senior citizen plans
