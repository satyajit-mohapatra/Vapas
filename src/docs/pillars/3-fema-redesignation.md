# FEMA Redesignation

**Priority: 🔴 MANDATORY**

## Overview

Under **FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act)** regulations, NRIs are **required** to convert their NRE/NRO accounts to Resident accounts within a reasonable timeframe after becoming Indian residents. This is not optional—failure to comply can result in severe penalties.

## Key Action

> **Inform bank within 30-60 days of becoming resident**

## Why It's Mandatory

When you return to India and become a "resident" under FEMA, you are legally required to:
1. Notify your banks about your change in residential status
2. Convert or close your NRI accounts
3. Update all documentation

Continuing to operate NRE/NRO accounts as an NRI when you are actually a resident is a **FEMA violation**.

## Account Conversion Rules

| Account Type | Required Action |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **NRE Savings Account** | Convert to Resident Savings OR transfer to RFC |
| **NRO Savings Account** | Convert to Resident Savings OR close |
| **NRE Fixed Deposits** | Re-designate as Resident FD immediately |
| **NRO Fixed Deposits** | Continue (interest becomes taxable) OR close |
| **FCNR(B) Deposits** | Can hold until maturity, then convert to Resident/RFC |
| **NRI Demat Account** | Close and open new Resident Demat, transfer securities |
| **Mutual Funds** | Update KYC status from NRI to Resident with AMCs |

## Benefits of Compliance

✅ **Avoids FEMA Violation** — Prevents penalties up to 3x the amount involved  
✅ **Preserves Account History** — Maintains your banking relationship and history  
✅ **Enables Full Access** — No restrictions on domestic transactions  
✅ **Investment Continuity** — Seamless transition of mutual funds and securities  
✅ **Smooth Tax Filing** — Proper classification for IT returns  

## Required Documents for Conversion

### Bank Account Conversion
1. ✅ Resident Savings Account Opening Form (signed by all holders)
2. ✅ Declaration of Change in Status (NRI → Resident)
3. ✅ Updated KYC documents (new Indian address proof)
4. ✅ PAN Card
5. ✅ Recent passport-sized photograph
6. ✅ FATCA/CRS Declaration
7. ✅ Passport with arrival stamps

### Demat Account Conversion
1. ✅ Closure request for NRI Demat
2. ✅ New Resident Demat account opening form
3. ✅ Securities transfer instruction
4. ✅ Updated KYC with Indian address

### Mutual Funds
1. ✅ Status Change Form (available from AMC or RTA)
2. ✅ Updated KYC with KRA (KYC Registration Agency)
3. ✅ New bank mandate (link to resident account)
4. ✅ FATCA/CRS declaration update

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Account Freezing** | Banks may freeze accounts pending status update |
| **Legal Penalties** | Up to **3x the amount involved** + daily penalty |
| **Tax Filing Issues** | Complications with Income Tax Returns |
| **Investment Blocks** | Mutual fund/stock transactions halted |
| **Credit Score Impact** | Frozen accounts can affect credit history |

### RBI/ED Enforcement
The **Enforcement Directorate (ED)** actively monitors FEMA compliance. Penalties under **Section 13 of FEMA**:
- Up to **3 times the amount involved** in the contravention
- Where amount is not quantifiable: up to **₹2 lakh**
- Plus **₹5,000 per day** for continuing violations

## Timeline

While there's no strict legal deadline, best practices recommend:

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Before Return** | Complete all inward remittances to NRE account |
| **Week 1-2** | Notify banks about status change |
| **30-60 Days** | Complete account conversion paperwork |
| **60-90 Days** | Verify all accounts, demat, MFs are updated |

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Documentation
Gather passport with arrival stamps, new Indian address proof, and PAN

### Step 2: Visit Your Bank Branch
In-person visit is typically required for status change

### Step 3: Submit Declaration
Provide written declaration of change in residential status

### Step 4: Choose Conversion Path
- NRE → Resident Savings (or RFC if eligible)
- NRO → Resident Savings (or close)

### Step 5: Update Linked Accounts
- Demat accounts
- Mutual fund folios
- Trading accounts

### Step 6: Verify Completion
- Obtain confirmation from bank
- Check new account numbers if applicable
- Update automatic payments/standing instructions

## Special Considerations

### NRE Fixed Deposits
- Must be re-designated immediately
- Interest earned post-conversion may be taxable as resident
- Can break FD and transfer to RFC if needed

### FCNR Deposits
- Can be held until maturity date
- Upon maturity, must convert to RFC or Resident Rupee account
- Interest remains tax-free until maturity

### Joint Accounts
- If one holder changes status, entire account treatment changes
- All joint holders must update documentation

### Power of Attorney
- Review and update any POAs given for NRI accounts
- POA holder roles may change post-conversion

## FEMA vs Income Tax Residency

**Important**: Residential status can differ under FEMA and Income Tax Act.

| Aspect | FEMA | Income Tax |
|--------|------|------------|
| Determining factor | Intent to stay | Number of days in India |
| When status changes | Upon returning with intent to settle | After meeting day-count threshold |
| Purpose | Foreign exchange compliance | Tax liability |

You could be:
- FEMA Resident but IT Non-Resident (arrived with intent but few days)
- FEMA NRI but IT Resident (frequent visits totaling 182+ days)

**Always consult a professional** to determine your status under both laws.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I keep my NRE account if I plan to go back abroad?
**A**: If you return to India intending to stay permanently, you must convert. "Intent" matters under FEMA. If your stay is genuinely temporary, consult a professional.

### Q: What happens to the interest in my NRE account?
**A**: NRE account interest was tax-free as NRI. Upon conversion, future interest becomes taxable. Consider transferring to RFC for continued tax efficiency during RNOR period.

### Q: Can I convert NRE back to NRI account if I leave again?
**A**: If you become an NRI again (by moving abroad), you can open new NRE/NRO accounts. But you cannot "revert" a converted resident account.
