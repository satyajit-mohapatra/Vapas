# RNOR Tax Shield

**Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL**

## Overview

The **Resident But Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR)** status is a transitional tax category in India that provides a powerful **1-3 year window** for returning NRIs during which **foreign income is exempt from Indian taxation**. This is the most significant tax benefit available to returning Indians.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for RNOR status, you must:

### Step 1: Meet Resident Criteria First
- Stay **182+ days** in India in a financial year, OR
- Stay **60+ days** in the year AND **365+ days** in the preceding 4 years

### Step 2: Meet RNOR Conditions
Then satisfy **one** of these:
- Been a **Non-Resident** in India for **at least 9 out of 10** preceding financial years, OR
- Been in India for **729 days or less** during the 7 preceding financial years

## Key Action

> **Be NRI in 9/10 preceding years to qualify**

## Tax Benefits During RNOR Period

| Income Type | Taxable in India? |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Dividends from foreign investments | ❌ **No** |
| Rental income from overseas property | ❌ **No** |
| Capital gains from international assets | ❌ **No** |
| Interest from foreign bank accounts | ❌ **No** |
| Pension from abroad | ❌ **No** |
| 401(k)/IRA withdrawals | ❌ **No** |
| NRE/FCNR account interest | ❌ **No** |
| Income earned in India | ✅ **Yes** |
| Business controlled from India | ✅ **Yes** |

## Duration

- Typically available for **2-3 financial years** after returning
- Exact duration depends on your prior NRI history
- Once conditions are no longer met, you become **Resident and Ordinarily Resident (ROR)**

## Additional Benefits

### 1. No Foreign Asset Reporting
RNORs are generally **exempt from reporting foreign assets** in Schedule FA of Indian income tax returns—a requirement for ordinary residents.

### 2. DTAA Benefits
Can still claim **Double Tax Avoidance Agreement** benefits to reduce tax liability on specific income taxed in both countries.

### 3. NRE/FCNR Account Interest
Interest on **NRE (Non-Resident External)** and **FCNR (Foreign Currency Non-Resident)** accounts remains **tax-free** until the RNOR status expires or the accounts mature.

### 4. Strategic Withdrawal Window
The RNOR period is ideal for:
- Withdrawing from foreign retirement accounts (401k, IRA)
- Receiving foreign dividends
- Selling foreign assets (capital gains tax-free in India)

## Exceptions: When Foreign Income IS Taxable

Even during RNOR status, foreign income is taxable in India if:
1. **Business controlled from India**: If you run a business that's controlled from India
2. **Profession set up in India**: If your professional practice is based in India
3. **Income earned in India**: Always fully taxable regardless of status

## Legal Basis

- **Section 6 of the Income Tax Act, 1961**: Defines residential status
- **Section 5(1)**: Defines scope of total income for residents
- **Finance Act 2020**: Introduced additional conditions for "deemed residents"

## Strategic Planning Tips

### Before Return
1. Ensure you've been NRI for 9 out of 10 preceding years
2. Calculate your days in India for the 7 preceding years (stay under 729)
3. Plan arrival date strategically (after October 2nd to preserve first year as NR)

### During RNOR Period
1. Maximize foreign income repatriation
2. Consider 401(k) withdrawals during this period
3. Sell foreign assets if planning to liquidate
4. File Form 10EE for Section 89A if needed

### Transition to ROR
1. Start reporting foreign assets in Schedule FA from Year 4+
2. Plan for worldwide income taxation
3. Consider GIFT City investments for continued tax efficiency

## 2024/2025 Treaty Shock Warning

⚠️ **Important Update**: US Treasury has disrupted the RNOR tax arbitrage.

- Until 2024, RNORs enjoyed unique arbitrage: India didn't tax US income, and US applied reduced withholding
- **New interpretation**: If not "liable to tax" on worldwide income in India, you may not claim treaty benefits
- **Impact**: US-sourced income may face flat **30% NRA withholding** without treaty protection
